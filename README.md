# Implementation of Cryptographic Primitives for BlockChain, by using Python 

Developing essential building blocks of cryptocurrency using block chains;
Signing given any message, generating a block of random transactions and PoW for the block,
integrating elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA),
generating a block-chain
